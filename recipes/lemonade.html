    <h2>Refreshing Lemonade to go with your Lasagna!</h2>
    <p>Lemonade is a sweetened beverage made from lemons, sugar, and water. It is popular worldwide during the spring and summer, when it is generally served chilled with ice.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Lemons</li>
        <li>1 Â¼ cups White Sugar</li>
        <li>5 cups Cold Water</li>
        <li>Ice Cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash lemons and peel off all the zest using a vegetable peeler; set peeled lemons aside. Add lemon zest to a bowl and cover with sugar; toss to combine. Cover and let sit for a minimum of 2 hours, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a pot over high heat; turn off heat and pour in lemon-sugar mixture. Stir and let sit until sugar is completely dissolved, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour through a mesh strainer back into the same bowl and discard the zest. Let cool to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut lemons in half and squeeze juice into the bowl. Pour lemonade into a serving pitcher; cover and chill thoroughly before serving over ice, at least 2 hours.</li>
